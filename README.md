# Search_engine_text_image
This project involves the design, development and evaluation of a multi-purpose system that includes a text search engine and an image search engine.The aim of this project is to provide users with a user-friendly interface to search for images based on their textual content, or to upload an image and find similar images in a database of images from Flickr. The system integrates technologies such as Elasticsearch, Streamlit and a pre-trained EfficientNet model to extract visual characteristics.
